# ygopro-doom

Doom Bots of Doom game mode for SRVPro.

## Attention

* This plugin only supports Koishi fork of YGOPro Server Mode. (https://github.com/purerosefallen/ygopro/tree/server)

* Installing this plugin would disable other game modes other than AI duel. It's recommended to set up another server other than the main server to use this plugin.

## Feature

The doom bots would cheat in duel. They draw extra cards, make extra summons, and even increase attack value for their monsters. They also always go first.

There are 10 levels of doom bots in this mode.

3. Copy `script` here into the `expansions` directory.

4. (Optional) set the value of `botlist` in SRVPro config to the path of `bots.json` here.
